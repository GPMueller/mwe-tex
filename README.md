LaTeX MWEs
==========

This project aims to provide useful and difficult examples, hopefully implemented efficiently.
Improvements suggestions or pull requests are of course welcome!

Each folder contains it's own Readme and the necessary data to compile.
The hope is that people might use these examples as guidance to create nicer plots and more
readable documents.

These MWEs are explicitly **unlicensed** so that they might be used freely, e.g. by students
writing a thesis or project paper.
